# ruleset
This module implements an incremental reduced error pruning (IREP) algorithm for growing classification rulesets.

See https://www.let.rug.nl/nerbonne/teach/learning/cohen95fast.pdf{Cohen, "Fast, Effective Rule Induction"}.  

For usage, see https://github.com/imoscovitz/ruleset/blob/master/irep/IREP_Demo.ipynb{my demonstration}.
